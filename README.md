# glasscord-companion
a companion theme to arytonex's glasscord plugin and css!

## Prerequisites
> [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/)
>> I also recommend the [Adjustable Server Width](https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/themes/Adjustable Server Width) plugin, but it's not necessary
> [Glasscord](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord)
>> and the [css](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord#how-do-i-use-it)
> [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/)

## Applying the Theme
1. Install BetterDiscord, then follow the instructions to install Glasscord
2. Download AryToNex's CSS from the Glasscord repo and place it in your BetterDiscord themes folder (typically this would be %appdata%/betterdiscord/themes, but you can also get there from the settings menu in Discord itself)
3.  In BetterDiscord's settings, **make sure that Normalize Classes is toggled on**!  My theme relies heavily on this feature and will not function properly without it.
4.  Place the Glasscord Companion code in your themes folder
5.  Toggle that bad bitch on!

## Known Issues
* Probably due in part to the fact that it runs in conjunction with another CSS, you'll have to unload and reload the theme for it to work properly.  
* I forgot to code the dark sidebar for servers lol
** As well, the dark sidebar currently relies on the "invert" css filter, so colors won't be perfectly accurate.  I'll work on that soon!
* Transparency doesn't seem to work immediately on load.  I think this has more to do with Glasscord and newer versions of BD.  Just reload Discord with Ctrl + R and it should be all right!
